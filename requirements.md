# Software requirements  
The vision of our project is to facilitate vacation planning. This project alieves the stresses of trying to find a spot to vacation for once a year. You should care about our project because it is laser-focused on one specific problem, and solves that problem well. 

## Scope  
Our project will:  
* Provide the user with a questionaire.  
* Use those results to generate an ideal vacation spot.
* Give the user relevent information to each location.  
* Store those results on the user's local storage.  
* Provide a variety of recommended locations in its gallery.  
 
 Our project will not:  
 * Book vacations.  
 * Give up-to-date information on the location.  

 ## MVP  

 MVP for our project will be to generate an itinerary for the user for at least 3 locations.  
  Our stretch goals are to add more locations, and create a more in-depth questionaire.
