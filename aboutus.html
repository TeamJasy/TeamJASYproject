      <p class="description">I want to be apart of building a safer and secure future with the use of computer software and cyber technology using my knowledge of medical terminology, electronic health record systems, and commercial and government health insurances. Additionally, I want to raise awareness to help individuals protect their digital life.
        <br>
        <br>
      Also, I love to travel. My next dream vacation is to visit Reykjav√≠k, Iceland for some music festivals and to see the aurora borealis in the night sky.

      <p class="description">Hello! My name is Adrian Cosme. I am an Army veteran with five years in the service. After serving, I made the move from Fayetteville, NC to Seattle, WA and started looking for a new career. In the mean time I got a job fundraising for the IRC where I met a lot of great people. After a few months of exploring my options I discovered Code Fellows! Ideally I will use my military experience, and knowledge of programming to start a new career in the defense industry.</p>

      <p class="description">Hello, my name is Stephen Martinez.  Before my journey here at Code Fellows, I was in the security industry.  Most recently I worked for Highline School District where I was a safety and security officer as well as a high school baseball and wrestling coach.  I was injured on the job and it got me thinking of what I could do while I was at home healing.  A family member told me I should look into what he does, which is software development.  I was very interested and when he showed me what he does and what he creates, I was hooked.  Ideally, I'd like to work in an environment where I'm helping people with the new skills that I'm learning.  I think my drive to help the people around me and my work ethic will set me in the right direction in my goals to becoming a successful Developer. </p>

      <p class="description">I am an army veteran of 17 yrs, a role model to 2 teenagers, and a forever student. I say forever, because everything evolves and if we don't take the time to evolve with these changes, we'll get left behind. Prior to changing my career path, I was in medical school. When medical school was no longer an option, I turned my attention to teaching myself web and graphic design. That lead to my business as a one-stop shop digital agency. It was designing websites on these plug and play platforms, that sparked my interest in software development. I want to be able to truly give my clients a personalized design that reflects their vision. I believe software development is going to open opportunities that I hadn't even considered possible. I chose software development specifically because I enjoy creating things and all things tech, but also because I have already missed so much of my children's lives while in med school, that this opened the door to remote employment. Ultimately, I would like to use my extensive medical knowledge and combine it with software development and create the next web application used as a standard in the healthcare industry.</p>
